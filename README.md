Smart College Bus Allocation System Using Big Data Analytics
Welcome to the Bus Allocation System repository! This project aims to optimize bus routes and allocation based on student and bus station locations.
This system leverages location and address data to map routes efficiently and improve transportation logistics for educational institutions.
		
Project Overview:
The Bus Allocation System project is designed to optimize the routing of buses within Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, based on student addresses and bus station locations. 
This system utilizes two main datasets:
Location Data: Contains geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for bus stations.
Student Data: Contains information about students' residential addresses for mapping and route optimization.

Objective:
The main goal of this project is to efficiently allocate buses based on proximity, capacity, and student demand.
This system aims to reduce travel time and improve the user experience for students relying on the bus service.
